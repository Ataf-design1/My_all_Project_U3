             Chemistry is the branch of science that deal with the properties composition and behaviour of matter it is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe

           The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.

       <h3>
            Chemical Equations
       </h3>
       
       <p>
           Chemical reaction are represented  using <i> chemical equation </i> 
            here's an example of a chemical reaction.
       
            
       </p>
       
       <p>
           2H2 + O2 = 2H2O
       </p>
       
       <p>
           This equation  represent the reaction between hydrogen gas <i> (H2)</i> and oxygen gas <i>(O2)</i> to form water <i> (H2O)</i>
       </p>

       <p> 
           Sociochemistry is the calculation of reaction and product in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equation to ensure mass and charge are conserved. Subscript indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while superscript represent charge on the number of atom in an ion.

       Conclusion
       </h5>
       
       <p>
           Chemistry play a crucial role in understanding the world around us from the composition of the air we breathe to the reaction That Power our bodies chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.
